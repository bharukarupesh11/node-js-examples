What is packag.json?
- It's a json file which contains your project information/metadata such as project name, version, 
  git repository location, dependencies etc.


Steps to create package.json:
1. To create package.json file run the below command in the root directory of your project, 
       'npm init'     OR     'npm init --yes'

Note: npm init --yes will avoid asking information of your project in command line and will create the package.json
      file with the default available information.
