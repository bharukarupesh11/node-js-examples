1. What is packag.json?
    - It's a json file which contains your project information/metadata such as project name, version, 
      git repository location, dependencies etc.


    Steps to create package.json:
    1. To create package.json file run the below command in the root directory of your project, 
       'npm init'     OR     'npm init --yes'

    Note: npm init --yes will avoid asking information of your project in command line and will create the package.json
      file with the default available information.


2. Installing 'underscore' node package using following command,
    npm i underscore

    What happens when we run above command?
    - In package.json file 'dependencies' property is added 
    - Under dependencies we can see the name of installed package i.e. 'underscore'
    - node_modules directory is created which contains all the information about the installed package

    So, whenever we do 'npm install' npm downloads the latest version of the given package from the registry
    and it stores that inside a folder called node_modules.

3. Using an 'underscore' package
   - To use any package inside our project we need to import it using require() function
