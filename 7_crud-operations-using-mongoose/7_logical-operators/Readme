Logical operators in MongoDB:
In mongoDB we've a bunch of operators for comparing values. Since mongoose
is built on top of mongodb driver, these standard operators that mongodb understands
is also available with mongoose.

Below is a list of various operatos,
1. or
2. and
=======================================================================
Model: A model is nothing but a blueprint which we call a class in oops terminology.
Using a model, we can create an objects.

Benefit of using mongodb:
Document in a mongodb can be a complex object. So, here this tags property is an array of
type string. We don't have something like that in relational databases. In other words
a row in a relational databases has a simple structure. If you wanna model this type of structure
in a relational database, you need 3 tables i.e. 
    1. courses
    2. tags
    3. courses_tags(3rd table): An intermediary table because of many to many relationship between courses and tags.

In mongodb or nosql database in general we don't have this structure. We don't have to define this tables.
We dont have to script them. We simply create our objects and store them in a databse.
That's why we call them schema less. They don't have schema.
=======================================================================
Schema: We use schema to define the shape of documents within a collection in mongodb.
Collection: A collection in mongodb is like a table in relational databases.
Document: A document in mongodb is kind of similar to a row in a relational database.

So, in a relational databases we've tables and rows. In mongodb we've 
collections and documents.

Each document is a container of key-value pairs. In a simple words, it's a
json object.


Note: In mongoose, we've the concept of schema. This's just specific to mongoose.
This is not a part of mongodb. We use a schema in mongoose to define the shape
of documents in a mongodb collection. So, we use that to define what are the
properties we've in this document. 

Below are the various schema types:
1. String
2. Number 
3. Date
4. Buffer: To store binary data
5. Boolean
6. ObjectID: To store unique identifier
7. Array
