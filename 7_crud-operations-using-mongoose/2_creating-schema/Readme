Schema: We use schema to define the shape of documents within a collection in mongodb.
Collection: A collection in mongodb is like a table in relational databases.
Document: A document in mongodb is kind of similar to a row in a relational database.

So, in a relational databases we've tables and rows. In mongodb we've 
collections and documents.

Each document is a container of key-value pairs. In a simple words, it's a
json object.


Note: In mongoose, we've the concept of schema. This's just specific to mongoose.
This is not a part of mongodb. We use a schema in mongoose to define the shape
of documents in a mongodb collection. So, we use that to define what are the
properties we've in this document. 

Below are the various schema types:
1. String
2. Number 
3. Date
4. Buffer: To store binary data
5. Boolean
6. ObjectID: To store unique identifier
7. Array
