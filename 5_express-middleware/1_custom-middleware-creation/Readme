What is middleware?
- A middleware is basically a function, that takes a request object and either returns a response to a client
or pass the control to other middleware functions.

So, every request that we get on the server will go through our middleware functions.

We can also create a custom middleware functions that we can put at the front of our request processing pipeline.
With these custom middleware functions we can perform cross cutting concerns 
    Eg. We can do logging, authentication, authorization and so on..

So an express application is essentially nothing but a bunch of middleware functions.


What does app.use(express.json()); is used for?
- The job of this express.json() function is to read the client request. If there is a json object in the body 
of the request it'll parse the body of the request into a json object and then it'll sets 'req.body' property.
