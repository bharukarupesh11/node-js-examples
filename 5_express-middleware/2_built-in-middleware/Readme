what is urlencoded?
- urlencoded() method parses the incoming requests with urlencoded payload i.e. a request with body like
  key=value&key=value

  This is more of a traditional approach. Basically, if you've a html form with the input fields and if you 
  post that form to the server the body of the request will look like this key and value pair.

  So, this urlencoded() middleware parses the body and populate req.body with a json object.
