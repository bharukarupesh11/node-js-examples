Transaction in rentals router:
In some relational databases like sql server or mysql, we've the concept of Transaction. So, transaction means a
a group of operations should be performed as a unite. So, either all these operations will complete and change the
state of the database or if something fails in the middle, all these operations that have been applied will be rollbacked
and our database will go back in the inital state.

In mongodb, we don't have transactions as we have in these relational databases. We've a technique called 
2 phase commit to get over this issue. 
    Read at: https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.6/tutorial/perform-two-phase-commits/


We've a npm package that gives us the concept of transaction but internally it implements this transactions
using the 2 phase commit technique.
    npm i fawn


Noite: The fawn package above has 3 vulnerabilities out of which 1 is high and other 2 are moderate. To know
more about them use 'npm audit' command and it will give you an audited report. 
    Also, read the details of each vulnerability by visiting the link in the report for every vulnerability.

In our case, 'fawn' package has a dependency as below,
     fawn > mongoose > mongodb
So, here the vulnerability which has a high priority is for mongodb version which is 2.2.33 and as per below
link version below 3 has issues in it. To know more,
