How to test this applcation for post request?
- The most simplest way is to use Postman endpoint connector tool. 

Following are the steps to do the same: 
1. Search for Postman Chrome and add it as an extension of a Chrome
2. Open the Postman from APPs section of chrome browser
3. Select the request type as 'POST'
4. Type in endpoint url as 'http://localhost:3000/api/courses'
5. Click on 'Body' option which is a request body 
6. Select the 'raw' option under request body
7. Select JSON(applcation/json) as a body format
8. Provide below request body,
    {
        "name": "new course"
    }
9. Click on Send button


Note: 
1. In the real life applcation we can't rely on the data sent by the end user. So, we need to check whether
   the data is correct or not by adding an input validation as a middleware.

   If the provided data is incorrect we must send a response with proper error message.

2. Use the 'joi' utility package of node for the input validation instead of writing a complex logic by yourself.
   - Install 'joi' package using 'npm i joi' command.

Schema: A schema defines the shape of our object.
        Eg.
        - What propertis do we have in that object
        - What is a type of each property
        - Do we have an email?
        - Do we have a string?
        - What is the min and max number of characters?
        - Do we have a number?
        - What range should that number be in?
