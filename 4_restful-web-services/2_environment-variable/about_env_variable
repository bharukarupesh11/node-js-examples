When we deploy an application to a hosting environment, the port is dynamically assigned by the 
hosting environment. So we can't rely on a hardcoded value like '3000' to be available.

So, the way to fix this is by using environment variable. So, in an hosting environment of node applications
we've this environment variable called 'PORT'.

An environment variable is a variable that is part of the environment in which process runs. It's value is set 
outside of the application.

To set the value of variable PORT in windows, use below command on a cmd prompt,
    set PORT=5000

Note: 5000 is a random port number

Now, run your application with the below command, 
    nodemon index.js
