nodemon is a utility package of node which continuously monitors our changes to the 
node files.

The benefit of using it is, we don't need to start our server for ever small change that we do in 
our code.

Note: nodemon is not required in a production as it's a utility class for dev so there's no need of 
      adding it in our project dependencies. Instead, we can install it globally in our local machine.

- Use below command to run your project, 
    nodemon index.js
